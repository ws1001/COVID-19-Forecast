# COVID-19-Forecast

COVID-19-Forecast is a Dash application written in Python that summarizes the latest coronavirus data and news and displays a time series forecast of new cases using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). It takes few minutes to load since the forecasting is done in a nonparametric fashion. It only works using Python 3, and the user needs to specify the News API token in the app file.
